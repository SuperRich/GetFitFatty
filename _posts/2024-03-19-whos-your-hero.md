Quick weight pit stop: 256.8lbs (18 st 5 lbs)

I need to make this fun for me. Now growing up one of my absolute favourite people in this world was a guy called "The Rock". Before he became hollywood famous, I'd get upset if I couldn't watch him on Sky One on Saturday mornings back in the day....the guy is just on another planet when it comes to charisma and he's jacked to the  gills.

I'll let you into a secret, I still am a huge fan now and have seen him live twice in the WWE but we're getting off track!

I'm gonna be copying one of his workouts I've found online this week, maybe two and today we're doing shoulders!


1. **Seated Military Press Machine**
   - Sets: 3
   - Reps: 21

2. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise**
   - Sets: 3
   - Reps: 8/8 (Superset with Dumbbell Front Raise)

3. **Dumbbell Front Raise**
   - Sets: 3
   - Reps: 8/8 (Superset with Dumbbell Lateral Raise)

4. **Rear Delt Cable Raise**
   - Sets: 3
   - Reps: 12, 10, 8, 6, 4

5. **Hammer Strength Shrug**
   - Sets: 5
   - Reps: 12, 10, 8, 6, 4

6. **Four Way Neck Machine**
   - Sets: 4
   - Reps: 12

Time passes....

So that was the plan and here is what actually happened....

I use an app called Strong to track my workouts so here it is in raw form.

Not quite like The Rock would have done but on my defense JD was rammed and I'll confess I have no clue what a four way neck machine is!

# Congratulations!
That's your workout number 228!
