I need to make this fun for me. Now growing up one of my absolute favourite people in this world was a guy called "The Rock". Before he became hollywood famous, I'd get upset if I couldn't watch him on Sky One on Saturday mornings back in the day....the guy is just on another planet when it comes to charisma and he's jacked to the  gills.

I'll let you into a secret, I still am a huge fan now and have seen him live twice in the WWE but we're getting off track!

I'm gonna be copying one of his workouts I've found online this week, maybe two and today we're doing shoulders!
