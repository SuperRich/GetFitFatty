Well let's reset as last week couldn't have gone worse!

So Hello, everybody! So, I've started this little project, and I must tell you, it's absolutely absurd. I’ve decided, in a moment of sheer madness, to document my journey from being a lovable, cuddly chap, into what I hope will be a slightly less cuddly chap, but with muscles. Yes, muscles! I know, I can hardly believe it myself!

Now, last week, oh my goodness, what a disaster! If my week were a TV show, it would be the kind you watch through your fingers, cringing and laughing at the same time. But here we are, ready to give it another go because, apparently, I love a challenge. And what better time to start than the week of the 18th of March? I mean, who needs New Year's resolutions when you can make mid-March resolutions, right? It's practically the same thing, only with more unpredictable weather!

So, this blog of mine, it’s not your average tale of 'Oh, look at me, I'm on a diet, I go to the gym, blah blah blah'. No, no, no. It's a saga! A saga of sweat, tears, and yes, the occasional slice of pizza. Because let's face it, life without pizza is like trying to clap with one hand: confusing and unsatisfying.

And amidst all this, I'm trying to transform myself. Transform from a man whose idea of a workout was running late, into a man who, well, runs. Actually runs! On purpose! And not just because the ice cream van is pulling away.

So, join me, won't you, on this ludicrous journey from 'fat man' to 'slightly less fat man with potential abs'.
