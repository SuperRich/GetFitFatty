Ah, today's the day we embark on our grand expedition to the gym, the land of sweat and tears! The mission? To conquer a staggering 3 kilometers on foot. A journey so epic, it's practically a trip to the fridge and back for a midnight snack.

And fueling this Herculean effort? For lunch, it's a mackerel sandwich. Yes, you heard that right. A mackerel sandwich. It's the midday feast of champions if the championship was held in a fishing village. But wait, the culinary adventure doesn't end there. For tea, it's fish and chips! Because why stop at dominating the sea for lunch when you can go for the double whammy and have it for tea too? It's like saying, "Look at me, Iâ€™m not just working out my legs today, I'm also giving my taste buds a marathon of the sea!"
